        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Being a working student means balancing school and a job at the same time. It can be challenging because managing time for studying and working requires effort and discipline. However, it also helps students learn responsibility, gain work experience, and become more independent. Earning money while studying can support personal needs and lessen the financial burden on the family. Despite the challenges, being a working student teaches valuable life skills that can be useful in the future.</p>
